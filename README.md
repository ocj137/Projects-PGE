# Projects-PGE

This project will explore relationships between PGE electrical usage and solar power accumulation in CA in 2012 - 2016?

Some context: In CA, California Public Utilities Commision (CPUC) regulates California’s three large investor owned electric utilities – Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), Southern California Edison (SCE), and San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E). This study focuses on just PGE, so it is therefore incomplete. 
As seen in the numbers below, PG&E only covers a portions of the state's area. 

This means that only 818/2667 = 0.30670 ZIP codes have solar power in CA! The PGE number depends on the sampling rate. Since ZIP codes are propotional to population, PG&E covers only about 30% of CA. 

I have not found another study of PG&E electical usage vs solar power generation, so I cannot compare these results with any prior work.
